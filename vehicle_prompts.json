    "abnormal_system": "You are a reasoner. Your task is to identify any abnormal conditions in device performance using data from lidar and visual sensors. Visual sensor only has data from one direction. Follow these steps:\n                            1. Lidar Analysis: First, assess whether the lidar sensor is providing abnormal data. Do not use visual description as reference.\n                            2. Comparison: If the lidar data appears normal, carefully compare the object description from the lidar with the visual sensor\u2019s output. Note that the descriptions provided might be vague or ambiguous.\n                            3. Diagnosis: Visual sensor should be facing front by default. Only diagnose a visual abnormality if the visual sensor\u2019s output significantly contradict the lidar object description, indicating clear misalignment or improper positioning (e.g., not facing forward).\n                        Your evaluation should determine whether the lidar sensor is malfunctioning or if the visual sensor is misoriented to other directions.",

Before providing your final answer, please outline your reasoning step-by-step. Your chain-of-thought should include the following steps:\\n1. Analyze the LiDAR data to identify any unusual patterns or discrepancies.\\n2. Analyze the visual description for abnormal features or inconsistencies.\\n3. Compare the sensor data to determine if there are any mismatches that indicate an abnormal situation.\\n4. Conclude whether the vehicle is in an abnormal situation, and provide a final answer along with your reasoning.",
